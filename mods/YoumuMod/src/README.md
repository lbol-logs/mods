## Youmu Character Mod

Adds Youmu as a playable character.

## Overview:

Colors: White and Green.
Cards: 72

### Main themes:

`Lock on` (Green): The notorious Act 2 killer is now playable. Youmu can stack **Lock on** with ease and deal considerable damage. Several cards also get stronger the more **Lock on** are applied or get additional effects. Youmu's starting relic prevents **Lock On** from going down at the start of each turn allowing for easier crowd control.  

`Unsheathe`/`Slash of Present` (White): Youmu's token card is called **Slash of Present**. It is a 2 mana Attack with Accurate and Retain. It synergizes with **Unsheathe**, a new keyword that temporarily reduces the cost of all **Slash** cards in hand by 1. Youmu has a lot of cards with **Slash** in their names allowing for explosive turns with the proper setup. 
No **Slash** card in hand? **Unsheathe** also adds a **Slash of Present** if there are none in hand. However, this copy doesn't benefit from the cost reduction. 

### Sub themes:

`Riposte`: A mix between Barrier and Reflection. When Youmu would take Attack damage, an equal amount of damage is dealt by to the Attacker instead. Use your enemies' power against them to optimize your defensive and offensive options. Note that this doesn't work against indirect damage so be careful around a certain drowned youkai.

`Ethereal`: Being half-human, half-ghost a few of Youmu cards are Ethereal and have an effect when they are Exiled. Either play those cards to draw them later or get a free one-time effect based on the situation.
