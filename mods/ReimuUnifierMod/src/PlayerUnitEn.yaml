  DialogueFairies11: |- 
   But if the Fairies are helping me, who am I fighting exactly?...
  DialogueFairies21: |- 
   C'mon you three! Join the lunatic party!
  DialogueFairies22: |- 
   Sorry Clownpiece, but we have to help her as punishment for our last prank...
  DialogueFairies31: |- 
   Hey you three! Back for round two?
  DialogueFairies32: |- 
   You can't beat us with Reimu on our side, Cirno.
  DialogueAya1: |- 
   It's a speed mirage!
  DialogueAya2: |- 
   Ah, Lady Aya! I'm practicing my transformation. Is it convincing?
  DialogueShinmyoumaru1: |- 
   Seija! I'm here for the Mallet's magic!!
  DialogueShinmyoumaru2: |- 
   Oh? But what about our revolution?
  DialogueShinmyoumaru3: |- 
   I keep telling you! We already lost! Now give it back!!
  DialogueShion1: |- 
   Awww, we have to fight Tenshi? But I really like her...
  DialogueShion2: |- 
   Don't worry Shion, I enjoy a good scrap. Now give me your best shot!
  DialogueKasen1: |- 
   The celestial huh? Seems like a good test for my training.
  DialogueKasen2: |- 
   You can't defeat me, hermit! I'll show you...
  DialogueMarisa1: |- 
   Ah! There she is! The kitsune copycat!
  DialogueMarisa21: |- 
   Marisa, Lady Patchouli has sent me to collect her books.
  DialogueMarisa22: |- 
   C'mon, what's a few tens of years of waiting for an immortal?
  DialogueMarisa23: |- 
   My apologies, but it's not a request this time...
  DialogueMarisa31: |- 
   Marisa! It seems your ways of thievery haven't changed!
  DialogueMarisa32: |- 
   W-We're just trying to solve the incident! We'll give the exhibits back later!
  DialogueNitori1: |- 
   That's the out of control Robo Nitori prototype! Can you take it down?
  DialogueNitori2: |- 
   Fine, but remember, you're helping me for the rest of this incident.
  DialogueSumireko: |- 
   D-Doremy?! Please tell me I'm not still in that nightmare...
  DialogueAunn1: |- 
   Two Reimus?! I guess I'll bring my other self too...
  DialogueAunn2: |- 
   Sorry Miss Sanae, I'm helping out Miss Reimu today!
  DialogueSanae1: |- 
   Another me? Could that be.... An impostor?!
  DialogueSanae2: |- 
   Hey! How dare you impersonate the gods of the Moriya Shrine?!
  DialogueSanae3: |- 
   Another Reimu? What's going on here?
