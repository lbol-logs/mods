# Reimu, Unifier of Gensokyo Character Mod
## Adds ReimuAlter, a Teammate-focused version of Reimu, as a playable character.

### Overview:
Colors: Red/White
<br>
Cards: 80ish (Plus a couple card exclusive tokens)

<br>
Main Theme: Teammates.
<br> I think the mechanic is underexplored in the main game and had 2 goals when making this character. Trying to remove the thinking that Teammates are green just because Green Cirno happens to be the only vanilla Teammate character, and exploring a mechanic that I really love through the use of weird templates, wacky abilities and different ways to use active skills and generate Unity or resources for teammates.

<br>

### Shot Types:
ReimuA, Red, Team Ups: Reimu A is the more aggresive of the 2 shot types. This side of Reimu focuses on setting up Teammates short-term in order to deal high amounts of burst damage through Teammate Active Skills and ReimuAlter's Unique mechanic, Team Ups. Team Ups are inspired by Cirno's "Wingbeats Flight", and they grant your cards certain powerful effects if you have a Teammate that fulfills a specific condition summoned in your hand, be it a Teammate of a certain color, or any version of a specific character related to the Team Up card (even vanilla versions of characters in the mod like Tri-color Yukari can active their character Team-Ups). ReimuA also looks to use Youkai-Forged Needles, one of her main two tokens, to increase her burst damage even higher, making these Retain tokens free for the turn when she plays a Teammate's active or ultimate skill them and then dealing massive damage.

ReimuB, White, Teammates and Setup: Reimu B has a more defensive focus, trying to tank up while setting up Teammates for long term power and strong defenses. Using abilities and Teammates to generate passive block while also directly activating her Teammates passive skills and increasing their unity directly, in order to finish the combat by unleashing devastating Ultimate Abilities. While setting up your Teammate fortress, you'll find yourself using Reimu's other token, Communicator Orbs, a cheaper version of vanilla Reimu's Yin-Yang Orbs that starts out weaker than the original orbs but scales its strength based on how many summoned Teammates there are in your hand.

### Additional notes
Bug reports, card suggestions, balance feedback are appreciated. For feedback, post your suggestions in the modding channel in the Lbol discord. You can also tag me @saevin_7 in said server and/or channel.<br>

### On the mod's art:
I'm far from an actual artist, despise the use of AI for art, and while I understand why it happens in modding scenes and don't think it's a big issue in non-commercial projects, I still dislike using fanart without permission for card arts myself. As such, the art in the mod was made with the idea of making the cards easily identifiable and maybe getting a chuckle out of people, but it's very much not high quality art like the vanilla game's (as it's sometimes said, if you can't be pretty, be funny, and my art's certainly not pretty). If anyone wishes to contribute their own art to the mod, I'll happily introduce any art that I think represents the card it's for reasonably well with due credit both in the card itself (as with all LBoL cards) and in a credits section to be added in this Readme, though I should note I intend to make community submitted art alternate art for the sake of art style consistency (which also means if enough is submitted to cover most or all cards I will set my own art to be the alternate version instead and use the community art as the main one).

### Planned future changes:
Each of these is likely coming in a different patch, though I intend to do some of them asap:<br>
General bugfixing, card text formatting fixes and balance changes. (Hopefully mostly done)<br>
Dialogue interactions for specific cards (like playing Aya, Reporter of Fantasy in the Aya elite fight). (Implemented in 1.1.0)<br>
Art for exhibits, spellcards and status effects.<br>
Adding at least 1 specific Team-up for every character that has a Teammate card, some of currently existing cards and some of possibly new cards.<br>
Uploading the mod's code to github. (Done!)
