# Changelog
## 1.1.3

Added changes from 1.1.2 which was only uploaded to Steam (my bad), fixing a bug that caused a lock when playing Call to Arms and an issue with ReimuA's spellcard preview. <br>

Modified the starting teammates to improve their usability.<br>
Upshifted Shinmyomaru, Inchling Princess to rare.<br>
Slight corrections to card text.<br>
Added a spanish translation and a provisional chinese translation.<br>

## 1.1.1

Added LBoL 1.8.0 compatibility. If you wish to stay on 1.7 don't update the mod or use an older version. The mod is now available through the steam workshop as well.

## 1.1.0
### As last patch mentioned, due to internal card name changes, the update will likely corrupt ongoing runs. This should be the last patch to have internal name changes, apologies for the inconvenience.
### Balance and gameplay changes

- Reworked ReimuB's exhibit effect: At the end of your turn, gain 1 Block for each summoned Teammate in hand. -> Whenever you summon a Teammate by playing it, gain 3 Barrier.
- Changed Scarlet Needle Rain's visuals to something more appropiate
- Aya, Reporter of Fantasy: Since nobody wants to read her newspapers, they now gain Auto-exile as well, to avoid clogging your hand along with Teammates. (This won't give you graze, just prevent missing draws.)
- Embodiment of Scarlet Devil: Remilia stopped lazying around. You can only play 5 cards on the extra turn given by this card before she ends your turn now.
- Youkai-Forged Needles: Changed free cost condition to "Played a Teammate's Active or Ultimate skill this turn". 
- Sanae, Human God: Has too much faith and is becoming too powerful. Reimu increased her cost from 1W to 2W to keep her from stealing all her worshippers.
- Danmaku Collision: Upgraded version block gain reduced from 4 per teammate to 3 per teammate. Card is part of the character fantasy I'm looking for but if it's too powerful it incentivizes bad play patterns that make gameplay *too* passive.
- Shinmyoumaru, Inchling Princess: Has spent too much of the Miracle Mallet's power. Merciless rod now adds 1 Firepower and 1 Temporary Firepower when upgraded, rather than 2 Firepower.
- Synchronized Ritual Array damage from 3(4) to 5(6)

### Bugfixes:
- ReimuA Starting exhibit now properly resets on combat end (Only visual)
- Fixed some visual bugs with Kosuzu, Deciphering Bibliophile's buff removal.

### New feature!

- Some cards now have dialogue interactions during certain combats for additional flavor, mostly related to lore relationships in canon, but also some of the more bizarre situations the mod can present (Like playing Sanae vs Sanae).

### Localization

- Korean localization properly tested and up to date with current patch!
- Fixed some formatting and text description errors in a few cards and ReimuA's exhibit, along with some additional detail texts.

## 1.0.1
### Warning: Due to internal card name changes to facilitate localization, this patch and 1.1.0 will likely corrupt on-going runs. If you wish to finish your run, make sure to do so before updating.
### Bug fixes
 - "Suika, Oni of the Gourd": no longer gives way more temporary firepower than intended with her Ultimate.
 - "Reinforced Boundary": no longer activates passive Unity gain twice.
 - "Aunn, Shrine Guardian": is no longer resilient enough to survive passively going into negative Unity.
 - "Hermit's Training": Reimu has gotten lazy again. She can no longer gain the card's barrier without Temporary Firepower. 
### Localization
Added Korean translation by coward_montblanc. (Testing still pending)

## 1.0.0
