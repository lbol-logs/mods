## Momiji Character Mod.

Adds Momiji Inubashiri as a playable character to Lost branch of Legend

## Overview:

Momiji uses Red and White mana, similar to Reimu. Her card pool contains 78 cards.

### Main Themes:

*Retaliation* (White): Momiji is capable of stacking a new status effect called Retaliation, which generates Reflection equal to its current level at the start of each turn. Several cards also scale with the amount of Retaliation Momiji has.

*Vulnerable* (Red): Momiji has many cards that apply Vulnerable, and several cards that either gain a bonus effect if an enemy has Vulnerable, or gain scaling effects based on the amount of Vulnerable the target has.

### Secondary Themes:

*Intentions*: Momiji has several cards that care about what the enemy is doing, grouped into three broad categories of **Offensive**, **Defensive**, and **Special** intentions. 

*Air Cutters*: A token card of choice for Momiji, **Air Cutters** are a cheap, one-use token that is fairly powerful, but has Ethereal, so it can only be used on the turn it is created.

## Additional Notes:

Bug reports, card suggestions, balance feedback are appreciated. For feedback, post your suggestions in the modding channel in the LBoL Discord.

## Special Thanks:

A massive thank you to the LBoL Modding Discord server, without which I never would have made this mod. Specifically, I would like to highlight a few individuals who helped me massively during the creation process:
* Zoisit, whose knowledge of C# was invaluable
* Saevin_7, who playtested Momiji consistently and gave invaluable feedback
* Lvalon, who also playtested Momiji and provided invaluable feedback
* rmrfmaxx, who provided an amazing template that allowed me to hit the ground running with creating Momiji
* IntoxicatedKid, who created the code that Momiji uses to read the intentions of enemies, without which, this mod would be very different.
* cyaneko, for being there to help with coding issues whenever I had problems
