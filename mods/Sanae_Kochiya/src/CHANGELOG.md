## 0.5.4: 

* Added Japanese Translation, which is updated to v0.5.4 (thanks nazotuki!)

## 0.5.3: 

* Nerfed the Sanae Act 1 boss Bulwark generation;<br>
  Gohei Whack no longer provides Bulwark, and Sanae instead applies 1 Frail<br>
  Barricade will still be 2/2/3 Bulwark, but it will be reduced to 1 if Sanae already has Bulwark
* Fixed Sanae's localisation issue, which was actually a Sideloader issue. Make sure to update Sideloader!<br>
  (thanks to rm -rf Maxx "c" for the help)
* Updated Korean Translation

- Reworded Sharp Breeze for clarity
- Increased the attacking amount of Sharp Breeze from 2(3) to 3(4)
- Increased Power gain of Transient Faith from 100(150) to 150(250)
- Fixed Bulwark's bad interaction with Lunar Rainbow Market, by moving cards into Exile
  instead of Exiling them when the Player has the buff

## 0.5.2: 

* Fixed the Sanae Act 1 boss not providing her own Exhibits.
  The localisation issue hasn't been fixed yet, if anyone knows how to fix it I'd appeciate the help

- Decreased Magic Burst's Block from 4(20) to 2(16), and increased cost from 0 to 1
- Fixed Magic Burst not providing Block when the Player didn't have any,
  and the given Block now interacts properly with Spirit and Frail

## 0.5.1: 

* Added Sanae Act 1 boss:<br>
  This boss uses Bulwark(synonym for Ward) to Exile any non-Status cards which are added, consuming one level.<br>
  Instead of gaining Firepower, she gains Spirit and applies Spirit Down, similar to her Act 3 counterpart.<br>
* Updated Simplified Chinese Translation

- Known issues (I wanted to push the updated translation first, and then handle these for v0.5.2):<br>
  Intention names have been created but aren't implemented currently, some sorta Localisation issue idk how to fix<br>
  As an Act 1 boss, she doesn't provide her own Exhibit and will currently provide a Neutral Exhibit instead.<br>
  Probably because I had to name the boss "SanaeOne" instead of "Sanae" due to name overlapping with the Act 3 boss<br>
  Haven't checked, but I hope that the Act 3 boss Sanae doesn't provide Sanae exhibits...

## 0.5.0: 

* Added 2 new cards - Strength Testing and Magic Burst
